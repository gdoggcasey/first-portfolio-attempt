# first-portfolio-attempt
This is my first attempt at making a reasonable looking portfolio. It does not look reasonable. 

I followed a Kevin Powell tutorial for the navbar. The rest is following the freecodecamp.org portfolio project. I wanted to spend a bit more time making it look nicer but I quickly discovered that my time will be better spent learning more fundamentals and practicing. The link images at the bottom are black which is a terrible color choice, and I grabbed those images from the noun project.
